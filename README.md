# Conways Game of Life

I was curious about [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) after hearing about it in blog post. So I learned it briefly just to get a feel for it and experiment. 

Nim, as described on their homepage, can:

- create executables
- be compiled to C++, C, and JavaScript
- is great for embedded software

Ultimately, it was fun dipping my toes in the Nim ecosystem and make Conways _game of life_.
